# Module content guide

Every skill and course topic ("module") has four sections: **Assumptions**, **Formulas** (live
calculator), a **table, chart or diagram**, and a **Step-by-step** walkthrough. Content lives in
`src/data/modules/`. This guide is the standard every module is written and reviewed against.

## Standards

### 1. Accurate

- Formulas, rearrangements, units and constants are correct. Check every number in the worked
  example by hand.
- Variable ranges (`min`/`max`) are realistic for the lesson and never exclude a normal answer.
  For example, if the legs can be 12, the hypotenuse must be allowed past 12.
- Assumptions are true, and they are the conditions the formula actually needs.
- Vocabulary and notation match what students see in class at that level (Common Core for K–12
  math, NGSS for K–12 science, standard textbooks for college).

### 2. Most helpful for the student

- Assumptions say when the formula applies and what could trip the student up, not trivia.
- The worked example uses realistic, easy-to-check numbers.
- Step explanations say _why_ the rearrangement works in one sentence ("Divide both sides by
  the width"), not just what to type.
- Include the relations students actually use together, so any sensible set of inputs solves the
  rest. Don't add formulas that aren't part of the lesson.
- Order `startWith` so the value students most often solve for comes first. When a student types
  a new value, the oldest input is the one recalculated. For example, typing f(x) should move x,
  not the function's constants.

### 3. Simple and concise

- 2–4 assumptions, one line each where possible (about 20 words or fewer).
- Reading level fits the grade. Kindergarten through Grade 2 uses short, concrete words.
- Variable names are 1–3 words. Symbols are the ones the lesson uses.
- Nothing is explained twice across sections.

### 4. The best representation, not just one that works

Pick the picture a teacher would draw on the board for _this_ lesson. It should make the key idea
visible, and every value it shows must be a module variable, so moving it updates the formulas.

| Money                                      | Coins and bills                                                  |
| Functions and rates                        | Graph with the point, slope or area that matters                 |
| Growth over steps                          | Table of values (and/or graph)                                   |
| Forces, motion                             | Free-body or motion diagram                                      |
| Circuits                                   | Circuit diagram or I–V graph                                     |
| Processes with no formula                  | Labeled diagram or table, with a counting model if one is honest |

If no existing representation fits, add a new kind in `src/components/module/reps/` rather than
forcing an existing one.

## Topics without a natural formula

Use the simplest honest quantity model (counts, totals, rates, percentages) so the calculator
still teaches something true. If no quantity model is honest, say so in review and show only
the assumptions and a table or diagram.

## Review process (required for every new or changed module)

1. **Automated checks:** `pnpm test`. These check that each module matches the taxonomy, that the
   example satisfies every formula and range, that every rearrangement agrees with its formula and
   has an explanation, that every input combination reproduces the example, and that the
   walkthrough balances.
2. **Independent AI review:** run the `module-reviewer` agent (`.claude/agents/module-reviewer.md`)
   on the new or changed modules. It rechecks the math independently and reviews every module
   against the four standards above.
3. **Fix or answer every finding.** Record findings you intentionally don't act on, with the
   reason, in the pull request or commit message.
4. **Visual check:** open each module and confirm the representation reads well at phone width, in
   light and dark mode.
